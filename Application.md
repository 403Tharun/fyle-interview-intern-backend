- A principal can re-grade the assignments already graded by the teacher.
- A student can create and edit a draft assignment
- A student can list all his created assignments
- A student can submit a draft assignment to a teacher
- A teacher can list all assignments submitted to him
- A teacher can grade an assignment submitted to him

## Challenge

Please fork the repository into your account and continue the development in your fork.

Your tasks
- Add missing APIs mentioned here and get the automated tests to pass
- Add tests for grading API
- Please be aware that intentional bugs have been incorporated into the application, leading to test failures. Kindly address and rectify these issues as part of the assignment.
- All tests should pass
- Get the test coverage to 94% or above
- There are certain SQL tests present inside `tests/SQL/`. You have to write SQL in following files:
    - count_grade_A_assignments_by_teacher_with_max_grading.sql
    - number_of_graded_assignments_for_each_student.sql
- Optionally, Dockerize your application by creating a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file, providing clear documentation on building and running the application with Docker, to stand out in your submission

## Available APIs

### Auth
- header: "X-Principal"
